# _Pig Dice_

#### _Website allowing two users to play Pig Dice_

#### By _Joel Adams & Chris Swanner_

## Description

This website allows two users to play Pig Dice against one another. When the application is initialized the users may choose between playing with a 2, 6, or 10 sided die, and may enter their names. Players may then "roll" until they "hold" and accept their total score for the turn, or until they roll a 1 and their turn ends. First player to reach 100 points wins the game. Then there are fireworks and much rejoicing.
